excerpt: About me

Hi, My name is Jay A. Cabasag a **Software Engineer**. I started working in a corporate company
back in September 12, 2022 after I obtained my **Bachelors Degree in Computer Science**.
I'm a web developer with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly websites. For the past months of experience in the industry,
I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and platforms.
<br />

<h2 className="mdx-sub-heading">How I started programming</h2>
<br />
When I was in my Senior Highschool days, My main goal is to get a bachelors degree in Education to become a Teacher beacuse back then I really want to help student 
learn or just want to teach them everything I know.
But it changed when I found this book that has a title of **`Web Development`** my curiosity started to kicks in.
I just read the book and found out that creating websites is interesting. So what I did is I get a laptop and
tried to work on adding simple website using plain HTML. By the way the book is not mine, I just forgot to return it to
my school. Actually, the book is still in my possesion. And during that time my **`strand`** don't work on 
codes I just do it since I'm curios and just want to learn how website works. Until I learned CSS then JavaScript.
So basically, JavaScript is my first language, I never have put so much thought about which programming
language I learned first but now I know it's **`JavaScript`**.
<br />
After I graduated senior highschool, This is like the biggest decision I should make
for my career and path that I'm going to take for the next couple of years in my existence and that I decided to take a course in **`Computer Science`**.
I found some of my classmates struggles with working on HTML and CSS. There's a lot of reason actually, some of them mentioned they
just ran out of options and just took the **`Computer Science`** or they call **`IT`**. You're right some of us might
think IT and computer science is the same. But, it's not really the same. And in my end, it's like I'm playing around since I already know about those things not
all but I know things about **`HTML`**, **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`** which is enough for a First Year Computer Science student.
<br />
During my college days, I've learned basics of programming using different programming langauges like **`Java`**, **`C#`**, **`C++`** and **`Python`** but it's just the basics
like adding 2 numbers and get the result. On my end, I tend to do something different and work on real things so I choose **Java** to master.
I've used **`Java`** for developing **`Android applications`** or even **`Desktop Applications`** that is connected to **`MySQL`** database. I know, most of us know MySQL since it's like
the database that is being taught to us not to mention it's widely used in a corporate industry.
<br />
On the last year of my college, I convinced my self that I want to work as an **`Android App Developer`** but then, this thesis that we want to work on needs to be a cross-platform.
All of my groupmates don't have knowledge in terms of working on **`IOS`** not to mention we don't have Mac Laptop. And we did a little brain storming and we found a solution which is the only way to solve this is to place it on the web. So what I did is I decided to research about what is programming language used by facebook
since the thesis we are working on is a social media app. And that I learned about **`React`**, it took me like a month of understand the basics of react it's not really that hard to learn it since
its just JS. On my second month of learning the basics of **`React`** I started to build a simple app using **`React`**. Then, started working on our Thesis. It took me like 4 months to complete the projects. And honestly, it was not easy for me.
It brought me lots of doubts and what ifs. It's like I'm always saying, I think we should just spend another year of our college. This is impossible since I'm the only one working on it both user web app and the admin side. But luckily I was able to
complete it and I'm so proud of myself for not giving up.
<br />
I graduated last **`August 25, 2022`**, and after a week or two I was able to get my first Job Offer from
 **`Vertere Global`** as a **`Fullstack Java Developer`** and another Job Offer as a **`Junior React Engineer`** at **`Metromart Technologies Inc.`** I choose the **`Junior React Engineer Role`**. I learned a lot from my Seniors and Co-workers. It's a remote work but still the collaboration of the
team is great.
<br />
Now, I still continous to learn other technologies and even master another programming languages like **`Java`** and **`Golang`** which I often use on my side projects specially when I'm working on **`Web Services`**. I know my journey is stil far from what I am aiming but I believe
I can get there in the future. I think that's enough information from me now, and hope you get a glimpse of my personality and my
dedication to programming. Thank you for reading this simple about me and have a great day and god may bless as all.
