excerpt: About me

Hi, My name is Jay A. Cabasag a **Software Engineer**. I started working in a corporate company
back in September 12, 2022 after I obtained my **Bachelors Degree in Computer Science**.
I'm a web developer with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly websites. For the past months of experience in the industry,
I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and platforms.

<h2 className="mdx-sub-heading">How I started programming</h2>
<br />
When I was in my Senior Highschool days, My main goal is to get a bachelors degree in Education to become a Teacher beacuse back then I really want to help student 
learn or just want to teach them everything I know.
But it changed when I found this book that has a title of **`Web Development`** my curiosity started to kicks in.
I just read the book and found out that creating websites is interesting. So what I did is I get a laptop and
tried to work on adding simple website using plain **`HTML`**. By the way the book is not mine, I just forgot to return it to
my school. Actually, the book is still in my possesion. And during that time my **`strand`** don't work on 
codes I do it as my hobby because I'm curios and just want to learn how website works until I started to learn **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`**.
So basically, **`JavaScript`** is my first programming language, I never had put so much thought about which programming
language I learned first but now I know it's **`JavaScript`**.
<br />
After I graduated senior highschool, This is like the biggest decision I should make
for my career and path that I'm going to take for the next couple of years in my existence and that I decided to take a course in **`Computer Science`**.
I found some of my classmates struggles with working on **`HTML`** and **`CSS`**. There's a lot of reason actually, some of them mentioned they
just ran out of options and just took the **`Computer Science`** or they call **`IT`**. You're right some of us might
think IT and computer science is the same. But, it's not really the same. And on my end, it's like I'm playing around because I already know about those things not
all but I know things about **`HTML`**, **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`** which is enough for a first year computer science student.
<br />
During my college days, we'd taught basics of programming using different programming langauges like **`Java`**, **`C#`**, **`C++`** and **`Python`** but it's just the basics
like adding 2 numbers and get the result. But in my case, I tend to do something different and work on real projects and that time I choose **Java** to master.
I've used **`Java`** for developing **`Android applications`** or even **`Desktop Applications`** that is connected to **`MySQL`** database. I know, most of us know MySQL since it's like
the database that is being taught to us not to mention it's widely used in a corporate industry.
<br />
On the last year of my college, I convinced my self that I want to work as an **`Android App Developer`** but then, this **`thesis/capstone`** that we want to work on needs to be a cross-platform.
All of my groupmates don't have knowledge in terms of working on **`IOS`** not to mention we don't have **`MacOS`** Laptop and I only have knowledge with **`Android App Develpment`** using **`Java`**  but not with **`IOS`**. To solve the problem we did a little brainstorming and we found a solution, and the only solution we could think of is to place it on the web. So what I did is I decided to research about what is programming language used by **`Facebook`**
since the thesis we are working on is a **`Social media app`** that's the time I learned about **`React`**, it took me like a month of understand the basics of **`react`** it's not really that hard to learn it since
its **`JavaScript`**. On my second month of learning the basics of **`React`** I started to build a simple app using it. Then, started working on our Thesis. It took me like 4 months to complete the projects. And honestly, it was not easy for me.
It brought me lots of stress, sleepless nights, doubts, what ifs and there's a time when I only sleep 2 hours a day straight for 1 week to prepare for our thesis presentation. It's like I'm always saying, I think we should just spend another year of our college. This is impossible since I'm the only one working on it both **`user side`** and the **`admin side`** the project is the **`CS Alumni Connect`** which you can check on my repository on **`github`** or projects section. Fortunately, I was able to
complete it and I'm so proud of myself for not giving up.
<br />
I graduated last **`August 25, 2022`**, and after a week or two I was able to get my first Job Offer from
 **`Vertere Global`** as a **`Fullstack Java Developer`** and another Job Offer as a **`Junior React Engineer`** at **`Metromart Technologies Inc.`** I've chosen the **`Junior React Engineer Role`**. I learned a lot from my Seniors and Co-workers. It's a remote work but still the collaboration of the
team is great.
<br />
Now, I still continous to learn other technologies and even master another programming languages like **`Java`** and **`Golang`** which I often use on my side projects specially when I'm working on **`Web Services`**. I know my journey is stil far from what I am aiming but I believe
I can get there in the future. I think that's enough information from me now, and hope you get a glimpse of my personality and my
dedication to programming. Thank you for reading this simple about me and have a great day and god may bless as all.
